      "To recap the previous section, a splayed table is split vertically along its columns and is subsequently mapped into memory. When a query is executed against the mapped table, column data is loaded as needed and is cached by the O/S. This reduces the table\u2019s memory footprint, especially for tables with many columns.\n",
      "\n",
      "A single day\u2019s trades and quotes work well as splayed tables, but several years of trades and quotes would result in very large column lists. When a table is so large that even the individual columns may not fit into memory, we can further decompose it by slicing horizontally. The solution for trades and quotes is to slice into daily portions.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.3.1 Partitions\n",
      "A partitioned table is a splayed tabled that is further decomposed by grouping records having common values along a column of special type. The allowable special column types have the property that the underlying value is an integer. The slice of records having a given value is splayed into a directory, called a partition, whose name is that value. In the canonical example, historical trades (or quotes) are stored in daily partition directories\u2014remember a q date is an integer under the covers.\n",

      "1.3.1.1 Partition Layout\n",
      "As with splaying, kdb+ implements partitioning via the OS directory structure. Each partition must be stored in a directory immediately under the database root directory. The directory name is the common column value for all the rows in the partition. Each partition directory in turn contains a subdirectory holding a splayed table with the records for that slice. This two dimensional decomposition is reflected in two levels of nested directories under the root.\n",
